I'm an Assistant professor in Bioinformatics 
 in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.vu.nl/) department at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl). I'm also a guest researcher at the [Netherlands Cancer Institute](https://www.nki.nl/).

I obtained my MSc in theoretical physics at the UvA, but evolved into a computational biologist. I did my PhD in the [Systems Biology group](http://teusinkbruggemanlab.nl/) of Bas Teusink and Frank Bruggeman, after which I did a postdoc in the [Computational Cancer Biology](https://ccb.nki.nl/) group of Lodewyk Wessels at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.

My lab focusses on computational approaches to understand signal transduction networks and the role they play in cancer. We're particularly excited about the possibilities of novel single cell technologies. By using a combination of statistical and mechanistic modeling approaches, we aim to bridge the gap between "top down" bioinformatics and "bottom up" systems biology.

## Hiring!

Together with the [Wessels lab](https://ccb.nki.nl/) , we are looking for a PhD candidate to develop computational approaches for multiplexed single-cell phospho-protein quantification. You can find the vacancy [here](https://workingat.vu.nl/ad/phd-position-in-computational-single-cell-cancer-biology/8zyfar)
